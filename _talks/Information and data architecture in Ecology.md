During my academic pursuit in ecology, I recognized a need for ecologists to adapt to the evolving landscape of data-driven research. This realization led me to develop and deliver a three-hour talk/lecture titled "Information and Data Architecture in Ecology: Folder Structure, Metadata, and Project Management through GitHub." In this talk, I address the need to optimize our workflow by utilizing tools and knowledge from information architecture and computer science. The lecture does not focus solely on statistical analyses but on practical aspects, such as project organization, script writing, and the utilization of tools like R-projects and GitHub. The goal is to empower fellow students/researchers to navigate the complexities of the computational dimension in ecology, fostering a more efficient and collaborative approach to ecological research in the era of big data and AI.
