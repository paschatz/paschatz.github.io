Originally from Greece, for the last couple of years, I have been living abroad. For the time being, my temporary home is in the south of Spain. I am a PhD candidate at the University of Cadiz. My research focuses on ecological coupling, and I am trying to find ways to detect ecosystem changes due to global change, using spatial and network analysis. I am interested in the effects of global change on plant communities and ecosystem functioning. Additionally, I am interested in the development of open-source tools for ecological research and data management. As a budding researcher, I feel committed to public, free, and accessible education for everyone and I am trying to contribute to this cause sharing all the componenets of my research (e.g. data, R-scripts).
